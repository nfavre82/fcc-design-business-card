# FreeCodeCamp – Business Card Project

This project was completed as part of the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design-v9/).

The goal of the exercise was to build a simple business card using basic HTML structure and CSS styling, while respecting the constraints defined by FreeCodeCamp.

- Working with colors and visual balance

## What I learned

- How to structure a small project from scratch
- How `max-width`, `width`, and `display` affect images
- How to create visual hierarchy with typography and color
- How to keep styles readable and organized
- How to use Git and GitHub to track and publish my work
- How to install, configure, and use GitHub CLI to create and update repositories from the terminal

## Notes

This is a learning project.  
I extended the original exercise with small stylistic choices (colors, spacing, typography) to reflect my personal learning progress while respecting FreeCodeCamp requirements.

## Tools & workflow (Git + GitHub CLI)

For this project, I practiced a basic developer workflow:

- Created the project locally using VS Code and the terminal
- Tracked changes with Git (`git add`, `git commit`)
- Published and updated the repository on GitHub using GitHub CLI (`gh`)
